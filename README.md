# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Using import math function, do the calculations
### Step 2: 
Take the two coordinates as l1,l2.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Using the print function, display the distance between two points.
### Step 5: 
End the program
### PROGRAM:

import math
l1=[4,2]
l2=[10,6]
d=math.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(d))
```
